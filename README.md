gcc (Ubuntu 9.4.0-1ubuntu1~20.04.1) 9.4.0


Use "make" to compile the programms.

{
    :dh_assign_1
    :rsa_assign_1
    :unit_testing

}
Use "make clean" to delete everything useless and fresh start.


After compilation: 

-- ./dh_assign_1 -h for further assistance
-- ./rsa_assign_1 -h for further assistance
-- ./unit_testing for some specific cases: BUGGY. *NEEDS ATTENTION*







** DEPENDENCIES **
util.h has been featured to include specific all in all functions to assist the development of dh and rsa encryption algos.

*WARNING* its not all complete. Some steps and functions may not be used, experimental cases or to be attended for further development and improvements.
For example:
    Primes in this tool are meant to be given by the user. There are some functions in util.h that are for random generation of large primes. (They don't work propery so far[almost] but are to be seen in the future!)
